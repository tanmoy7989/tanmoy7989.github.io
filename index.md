I am a computational structural biologist working on XX at Novo Nordisk Research.

Before that I was a postdoc with [Andrej Sali](https://www.salilab.org/) at UCSF, where I spent three developing bayesian inference methods for integrative modeling of large protein complexes by combining models obtained from comparative and de-novo modeling with experimental data from proteomics and cryo-EM. I also dabbled in developing and implementing bayesian frameworks for whole-cell modeling with specific focus on the pancreatic beta cell.

I collaborated extensively (and still do) with [Mike Rout](https://lab.rockefeller.edu/rout/) and [Brian Chait](https://lab.rockefeller.edu/chait/) at Rockfeller University, NYC and [John Aitchison](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/research/centers-programs/global-infectious-disease-research/research-areas-and-labs/aitchison-lab/) within the [National Center for Dynamic Interactome Research](https://www.ncdir.org/) to develop nanobody therapeutics that target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. 

I completed a PhD in Chemical Engineering from UCSB, where I worked with [M.Scott Shell](https://theshelllab.org/) in in building variational inference techniques for coarse graining of molecular dynamics simulations for liquid phase behavior, protein folding and self-assembly.

I spent the first 18 years of my life in the city of Kolkata in West Bengal on the east coast of India, and went to college at [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/CH).
