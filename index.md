I am a research scientist in computational chemistry and drug discovery. I work at [Novo Nordisk Research Center Seattle](href="https://www.novonordisk-us.com/about/who-we-are/seattle-wa.html"), where I design in-silico biologics for endocrine disorders using a combination of physics and machine learning approaches, and also develop software pipelines for protein-protein interactions.

I apply (and maintain active interest in) equal parts computational chemistry, structural biology and compound design, with a healthy addition of probabilistic machine learning such as variational inference and bayesian optimization.

Before transitioning permanently from academia, I spent three years (2019-2021) as a postdoctoral scholar at the [Andrej Sali laboratory](https://salilab.org/) at University of California San Francisco, working on integrative modeling of large protein complexes, drug-pathogen interactions and glucose-insulin dynamics in pancreatic beta cells. I maintain active collaborations with the [Rout](https://www.rockefeller.edu/our-scientists/heads-of-laboratories/896-michael-p-rout/) and [Chait](https://www.rockefeller.edu/our-scientists/heads-of-laboratories/902-brian-t-chait/) labs from [Rockefeller University](https://www.rockefeller.edu/) and the [Aitchison](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/research/centers-programs/global-infectious-disease-research/research-areas-and-labs/aitchison-lab/) lab at Seattle Children's Center for Global Infectious Disease Research as part of [the National Center for Dynamic Interactome Research](https://www.ncdir.org/) (NCDIR) consortium to develop nanobody based therapeutics for Covid-19. Some of my past collaborators from this time (as part of the [Pancreatic Beta Cell Consortium](https://dornsife.usc.edu/bridge-institute/pancreatic-beta-cell-consortium/#:~:text=The%20Pancreatic%20Beta%20Cell%20Consortium,of%20the%20pancreatic%20beta%20cell.)) include [Barak Raveh](https://www.ravehlab.org/), [Kate White](https://www.katewhitelab.com/), [Liping Sun](https://compbio.ihuman.shanghaitech.edu.cn/members.html), and [Jitin Singla](https://www.jitinsingla.in/).

I obtained a PhD in Chemical Engineering from [University of California Santa Barbara](https://www.chemengr.ucsb.edu/), where I worked with [M. Scott Shell](https://theshelllab.org/), where I developed variational inference methods for coarse-graining molecular dynamics simulations of fluid phase behavior and protein folding, and collaborated extensively with [Nico van der Vegt](https://www.cpc.tu-darmstadt.de/cpc/people_cpc/cpc_staff_details_55425.en.jsp) and [David Rosenberger](https://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/en/einrichtungen/ag/ag-clementi/team/David.html) at TU Darmstadt.

I have contributed potentials and post-processing utilities to the molecular dynamics software [LAMMPS](https://docs.lammps.org/pair_local_density.html), and continue to be a developer for the [Integrative Modeling Platform](https://github.com/salilab/imp).
