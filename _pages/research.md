## Coarse-grained backbone forcefields for molecular dynamics simulations of protein folding
<figure style="width: 30%" class="align-left">
  <img src="../assets/images/go_model.png" alt=Developed simplistic coarse-grained models of hydrophilic and hydrophobic poly-amino acids which can be intelligently combined to produce remarkably accurate backbone models for folding short peptide fragments as well as globular protein domains. This work was a proof of principle for protein backbone models designed from polymers using variational inference methods, and using only native contact based sidechain interactions demonstrated the potential to successfully fold 200+ residue proteins. Possible future directions include combining reduced alphabet and full alphabet sidechain interactions with aforementioned backbone forcefields to produce sequence chemistry dependent protein models>

## Local density potentials for coarse grained molecular dynamics simulations of liquid mixtures
<img align="left" style="width:35%;height:35%;margin:20px 30px" src="../assets/images/ld.png">
Developed computationally efficient manybody potentials for improving solvent models in implicit solvent simulations of polymer collapse and liquid-liquid phase separation in coarse-grained binary solutions of small hydrophobes (such as benzene or methanol in water). Depending only on the mean-field local density around solute particles, such potentials signficantly improved predictions of pair structure and clustering behavior of either component across widely varying mixture compositions. This work constitutes some of the very few structurally accurate molecular models of liquid-liquid phase separation in the chemical engineering literature
