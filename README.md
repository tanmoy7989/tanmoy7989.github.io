This is my personal website based on the immensely popular [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes) theme by [Michael Rose](https://github.com/mmistakes). 


The drop-down navigation bar for ```resume``` was generated using modifications suggested [here](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1801).

I borrowed several modifications to the css content from [this very helpful blog post](https://www.cross-validated.com/Personal-website-with-Minimal-Mistakes-Jekyll-Theme-HOWTO-Part-II/) by Katerina Bosko.
